# Cycles
Can you dodge the tail? This two-player game gets tougher as it goes! You and the opponent each get five tails at the beginning and the tail will grow by 3 hashtags every 20 seconds. Make sure to dodge the other players tail or you will lose!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
